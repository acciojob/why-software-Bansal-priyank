	<h1> Why i want to become a developer? </h1>

	<p>  I've always been fascinated by how technology shapes our lives, and becoming a software developer gives me the opportunity to be a part of that transformation. I enjoy solving problems, building useful applications, and constantly learning new things. Developing software allows me to be creative, collaborate with others, and create tools that can make a real difference in people's lives.</p>
